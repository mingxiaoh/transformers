# Efficient Inference on a Multiple CUDAs

This document contains information on how to efficiently infer on a multiple CUDAs. 
<Tip>

Note: A multi CUDA setup can use the majority of the strategies described in the [single CUDA section](./perf_infer_cuda_one). You must be aware of simple techniques, though, that can be used for a better usage.

</Tip>

## `BetterTransformer` for faster inference

We have recently integrated `BetterTransformer` for faster inference on multi-CUDA for text, image and audio models. Check the documentation about this integration [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/bettertransformer/overview) for more details.
