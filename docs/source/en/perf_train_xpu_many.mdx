# Efficient Training on Multiple XPUs

When training on a single XPU is too slow, we can use multiple XPUs. This guide focuses on PyTorch-based DDP enabling distributed XPU training efficiently.

## Intel® oneCCL Bindings for PyTorch

[Intel® oneCCL](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneCCL) (collective communications library) is a library for efficient distributed deep learning training implementing such collectives like allreduce, allgather, alltoall. For more information on oneCCL, please refer to the [oneCCL documentation](https://spec.oneapi.com/versions/latest/elements/oneCCL/source/index.html) and [oneCCL specification](https://spec.oneapi.com/versions/latest/elements/oneCCL/source/index.html).

Module `oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch` (`torch_ccl` before version 1.12)  implements PyTorch C10D ProcessGroup API and can be dynamically loaded as external ProcessGroup and only works on Linux platform now

Check more detailed information for [oneccl_bind_pt](https://github.com/intel/torch-ccl).

### Intel® oneCCL Bindings for PyTorch installation:

Wheel files are available for the following Python versions:

| Extension Version | Python 3.6 | Python 3.7 | Python 3.8 | Python 3.9 | Python 3.10 |
| :---------------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :---------: |
| 1.13.0            |            | √          | √          | √          | √           |
| 1.12.100          |            | √          | √          | √          | √           |
| 1.12.0            |            | √          | √          | √          | √           |
| 1.11.0            |            | √          | √          | √          | √           |
| 1.10.0            | √          | √          | √          | √          |             |

```
pip install oneccl_bind_pt=={pytorch_version} -f https://developer.intel.com/ipex-whl-stable-xpu
```
where `{pytorch_version}` should be your PyTorch version, for instance 1.13.0.
Check more approaches for [oneccl_bind_pt installation](https://github.com/intel/torch-ccl).
Versions of oneCCL and PyTorch must match.

<Tip warning={true}>

oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch 1.12.0 prebuilt wheel does not work with PyTorch 1.12.1 (it is for PyTorch 1.12.0)
PyTorch 1.12.1 should work with oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch 1.12.100

</Tip>

## Intel® MPI library
Use this standards-based MPI implementation to deliver flexible, efficient, scalable cluster messaging on Intel® architecture. This component is part of the Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit.

oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch is installed along with the MPI tool set. Need to source the environment before using it.

for Intel® oneCCL >= 1.12.0
```
oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch_path=$(python -c "from oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch import cwd; print(cwd)")
source $oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch_path/env/setvars.sh
```

for Intel® oneCCL whose version < 1.12.0
```
torch_ccl_path=$(python -c "import torch; import torch_ccl; import os;  print(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(torch_ccl.__file__)))")
source $torch_ccl_path/env/setvars.sh
```

## IPEX installation:
To build Intel® Extension for PyTorch*, please check [Installation Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/xpu/latest/tutorials/installation.html) for detailed information. Source code is available at the [xpu-master branch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/tree/xpu-master).


The following "Usage in Trainer" takes mpirun in Intel® MPI library as an example.


## Usage in Trainer
It will enable multi XPU distributed training in the Trainer with the ccl backend.

Let's see an example with the [question-answering example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering)


The following command enables training with 2 processes on one node, with one process running per device.
```shell script
 export MASTER_ADDR=127.0.0.1
 mpirun -n 2 \
 python3 run_qa.py \
 --model_name_or_path bert-large-uncased \
 --dataset_name squad \
 --do_train \
 --do_eval \
 --per_device_train_batch_size 12  \
 --learning_rate 3e-5  \
 --num_train_epochs 2  \
 --max_seq_length 384 \
 --doc_stride 128  \
 --output_dir /tmp/debug_squad/ \
 --no_cuda \
 --use_xpu
```
The following command enables training with a total of four processes on two nodes, two processes on each node.

In node0, you need to create a configuration file which contains the IP addresses of each node (for example hostfile) and pass that configuration file path as an argument.
```shell script
 cat hostfile
 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx #node0 ip
 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx #node1 ip
```
Now, run the following command in node0 and **4DDP** will be enabled in node0 and node1 with BF16 auto mixed precision:
```shell script
 mpirun -f hostfile -n 4 -ppn 2 \
 python3 run_qa.py \
 --model_name_or_path bert-large-uncased \
 --dataset_name squad \
 --do_train \
 --do_eval \
 --per_device_train_batch_size 12  \
 --learning_rate 3e-5  \
 --num_train_epochs 2  \
 --max_seq_length 384 \
 --doc_stride 128  \
 --output_dir /tmp/debug_squad/ \
 --no_cuda \
 --use_xpu \
 --bf16
```
